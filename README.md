## Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python 3.9.18 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (make sure to scroll down to the specific release version).
3. Install Conda [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). While **Miniconda** is recommended, either of the Miniconda or Anaconda distributions are fine. Conda is a virtual environment and package manager for Python.
4. Once Conda is installed, open terminal in the cloned GuitarBot directory.
5. Run `conda env create -f environment/environment.yml` to create a new Conda environment for the project. It will automatically be named *guitarbot_env*.
6. To verify that the environment was installed correctly, run `conda env list`. You should see *guitarbot_env* as one of the options listed.
7. Run `conda activate guitarbot_env` to activate the new environment.
8. Note that if you're running the project from an IDE, you will need to select your new environment as the Python interpreter. See VSCode example below:

![VSCode conda configuration](environment/screenshots/conda_configuration.png)

You're all set! Run the **UI/main.py** script to start the GuitarBot UI.

### To Update Environment Configuration:
1. Navigate to the **GuitarBot/environment** directory.
2. If not already activated, run `conda activate guitarbot_env` to activate the guitarbot environment.
3. Run `conda env export > environment.yml` to export the guitarbot environment to a new environment.yml file. Make sure to replace the existing environment.yml file.
